# Tag any devices that MM might be interested in; if ModemManager is started
# up right after udev, when MM explicitly requests devices on startup it may
# get devices that haven't had all rules run yet.  Thus, we tag devices we're
# interested in and when handling devices during MM startup we ignore any
# that don't have this tag.  MM will still get the udev 'add' event for the
# device a short while later and then process it as normal.
