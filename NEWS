ModemManager 1.8.0
-------------------------------------------
This is a new stable release of ModemManager.

The following notes are directed to package maintainers:

 * This version requires:
   ** GLib 2.36.0
   ** gettext 0.19.8 (for the optional rebuild of documentation)
   ** libmbim >= 1.16.0 (for the optional MBIM support)
   ** libqmi >= 1.20.0 (for the optional QMI support)
   ** libsystemd >= 209 or libsystemd-login >= 183 (for the optional suspend
      and resume support)
   ** libsystemd >= 209 (for the optional systemd journal support)
   ** polkit >= 0.97 (for the optional PolicyKit support)

 * This version no longer requires:
   ** intltool (replaced by new features in gettext)

 * Distributions using systemd should explicitly use the following configure
   options:
   ** '--with-systemd-suspend-resume': the only supported source for suspend and
   resume events is now systemd, so the previous '--with-suspend-resume=[]'
   option was renamed.
   ** '--with-systemd-journal' to use the new journal support.

 * Distributions wanting to avoid ModemManager poking TTY ports that isn't
   supposed to touch may start using the new 'STRICT' filter policy, given
   as an option to the ModemManager daemon (e.g. patching the default systemd
   service file provided). See below for more info about the filter policy and
   the side effects of using the STRICT approach:
   ** E.g. ModemManager --filter-policy=STRICT

The most important features and changes in this release are the following:

 * New 'filter policy' setting in the ModemManager daemon to decide which ports
   are probed and how. Currently these levels are defined:
   ** WHITELIST-ONLY: Only devices or ports explicitly whitelisted with the new
      'ID_MM_DEVICE_PROCESS' udev tag are probed.
   ** DEFAULT: All ports are allowed to be probed except for the ones explicitly
      greylisted as RS232 adapters or completely blacklisted. This is the
      default approach that was used until now, and the default as well in this
      release if a different one isn't requested.
   ** STRICT: The daemon defines a set of heuristics to try to detect modems and
      ports to probe. Only the TTY ports that are very very likely to be modem
      ports are probed, therefore completely avoiding the need of having a
      separate blacklist or RS232 adapter greylist. But note that this policy
      may end up ignoring some devices, like TTY controlled modems without an
      associated network port.
   ** PARANOID: This is equivalent to running the STRICT mode but also applying
      the blacklist and RS232 greylist filters explicitly.

 * Device 'naming'. This release includes logic to allow 'naming' devices with
   the ID_MM_PHYSDEV_UID udev tag, so that the names can then be used in e.g.
   mmcli and also exposed in the 'Device' property in the Modem interface. This
   new setup makes it possible to give the devices unique names that are kept
   across reboots.

 * Allow skipping the automatic scan for devices in the daemon with the new
   '--no-auto-scan' daemon option. Instead, the daemon may be called with the
   '--initial-kernel-events=[PATH]' option including a predefined list of ports
   or otherwise get the port additions reported during runtime with the
   mmcli --report-kernel-event=[] command.

 * Allow building and running without 'udev'. In this setup, the previously
   explained '--no-auto-scan' is enabled by default, so ports are not
   automatically detected .Note that this setup is not suggested for standard
   distributions: if udev is available in the system, it is the preferred method
   to manage the port addition and removal.

 * SIM hot swap. The core includes the needed logic to support SIM hot swap in
   the different devices, although for now it's only tested for Telit and MBIM
   modems. If a SIM hot swap is detected, the modem is flagged as failed and
   reprobed from scratch.

 * Connection status monitoring logic. In order to try to detect network
   initiated disconnections, a generic setup is provided to plugins so that they
   can implement explicit connection status checks that would be executed
   periodically.

 * New support for 3GPP CSFB states and operation modes. We now support
   registration states reported as "SMS only" or "CSFB not preferred", and
   provide APIs to set and get the "UE mode of operation for EPS".

This version comes with the following new features:

 * Build and system:
   ** Updated the systemd service file with additional security related rules.
   ** Added support for systemd journal logging.
   ** Updated most of the code to use GTask instead of the deprecated
      GSimpleAsyncResult based operations.
   ** ChangeLog is built from git during the dist tarball generation.

 * New translations: Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Slovak, Hungarian, Czech,
   Ukrainian, Swedish and Indonesian.

 * API:
   ** Defined additional GSM, UMTS and LTE frequency bands.
   ** The MMModemBand enumeration values (EUTRAN, UTRAN and CDMA) have been
      renamed to consolidate how they are defined. A compatibility layer has
      been provided to avoid breaking the API.
   ** New 'HardwareRevision' property in the Modem interface.
   ** New 'EpsUeModeOperation' property and 'SetEpsUeModeOperation' method in
      the Modem 3GPP interface.

 * Core:
   ** Updated libqcdm to load signal strength from QCDM EVDO Pilot Sets.
   ** Updated udev rules with new per-vendor rules for quicker processing.
   ** Explicitly ignored ports are never probed now, but they will be reported
      as owned by the device and exposed in the Ports property.
   ** New 'ID_MM_TTY_BAUDRATE' udev tag to specify the baudrate to use in RS232
      TTY ports.
   ** If using UCS2, still assume that the operator name may be given in ASCII.
   ** Explicitly open QCDM ports anytime it's needed, instead of assuming they
      are open when enabled.
   ** Query supported ME event reporting options and automatically set the best
      choice based on the supported ones.
   ** Query supported flow control modems and automatically set the best choice
      based on the supported ones.
   ** Explicitly configure flow control settings on the TTY as soon as it is
      connected, only applicable for RS232 devices.
   ** Implemented generic unlock retries loading.

 * MBIM:
   ** Explicitly reprobe the modem when the mbim-proxy is detected dead.
   ** Workaround implemented to keep track of the PIN1 unlock retries as the
      protocol isn't very good allowing this.
   ** Load and expose HW revision.

 * QMI:
   ** Explicitly reprobe the modem when the qmi-proxy is detected dead.
   ** Load and expose HW revision.
   ** Detect port closed and forbid client allocation operations.
   ** New optional connection status monitoring support, enabled by default for
      the Netgear AC341U.

 * Location interface:
   ** Disabled by default for MBIM modems.

 * Messaging interface:
   ** Try decoding with UTF-16BE when UCS-2 reported.

 * Plugins:
   ** u-blox: new plugin, currently supporting the TOBY-L2, TOBY-L4, TOBY-R2,
      LARA-R2 and LISA-R2.
   ** quectel: new plugin, supporting generic AT/QMI based modems.
   ** cinterion: implemented support for devices exposing a WWAN network
      interface.
   ** cinterion: support changing modes in LTE capable devices.
   ** cinterion: added GPS support for devices controlled only with AT^SGPSC.
   ** cinterion: use ^SIND unsolicited messages for access tech reporting.
   ** huawei: implemented Signal interface.
   ** telit: added support for RS232, QMI and MBIM modems.
   ** novatel: cleaned up registration state and access tech reporting.
   ** novatel-lte: implemented unlock retries loading.

   ** mbm: added GPS support for the Dell DW5560.

The following features which were backported to 1.6.x releases are also present
in ModemManager 1.8.0:

 * Build and System:
   ** Explicitly use -DGLIB_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED=GLIB_VERSION_2_36 and
      -DGLIB_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED=GLIB_VERSION_2_36 so that we don't get warnings
      for GLib features that are flagged as deprecated in newer versions.
   ** Dropped After=syslog.target rule in systemd service file.
   ** Added all ModemManager udev tags also in "bind" events.

 * Plugins:
   ** huawei: let the E3372 run NDISDUP via TTY (when the exposed cdc-wdm is
      non-functional).
   ** telit: added support for the GE910.

ModemManager 1.6.0
-------------------------------------------
This is a new stable release of ModemManager.

 * This version requires:
   ** GLib 2.36.0
   ** gettext 0.19.3
   ** libmbim >= 1.14.0 (for the optional MBIM support)
   ** libqmi >= 1.16.0 (for the optional QMI support)
   ** libsystemd >= 209 or libsystemd-login >= 183 (for the optional suspend
      and resume support)

 * For distributions using systemd, it is suggested that the new optional
   suspend/resume is explicitly requested during configure with the new
   '--with-suspend-resume=systemd' argument.

This version comes with the following new features:

 * Core:
   ** Implemented support for suspend/resume detection, currently working
      when systemd is in use. Whenever the system is suspended, we'll flag the
      modems as invalid so that they are re-probed from scratch when the system
      is resumed.
   ** Added cancellation support for the probing operations.
   ** Reworked and simplified the serial port response processing.

 * Location interface:
   ** Added A-GPS support, currently available only for QMI based modems with
      PDS service.
   ** Added support for updating the default GPS refresh time.

 * Time interface:
   ** New default implementation for all AT-based modems.

 * Voice interface:
   ** New DBus interface to allow the management of voice calls, which currently
      assumes that the audio channel is setup out of ModemManager.

 * Bearer:
   ** New support for reporting statistics of the ongoing connection with a new
      'Stats' property, currently available for QMI and MBIM based modems.

 * QMI:
   ** Implemented support for devices which only work in "raw IP" mode, like
      the Sierra MC7455.
   ** Implemented support for SIM related operations using the UIM service, as
      newer modems with multi-SIM capabilities don't suppor the legacy DMS UIM
      operations.
   ** Implemented support for detecting network-initiated disconnections.

 * MBIM:
   ** If online mode fails, try to use the 'DMS Set FCC Authentication' QMI
      message via the QMI-over-MBIM support, if supported by the device.

 * udev:
   ** Added new supported 'ID_MM_PORT_IGNORE' tag to allow fully ignoring ports
      specified by the user.

 * mmcli:
   ** Added command completion.
   ** Added new operations to use the Voice interface.
   ** Added new operations to manage the A-GPS settings.

 * Build:
   ** Added code coverage support.

 * Plugins:
   ** haier: new plugin to support the Haier CE81B.
   ** thuraya: new plugin for Thuraya satellite modems.
   ** sierra-legacy,sierra: the implementation for Sierra modems is now split
      into two different plugins: a 'legacy' one for the old PPP and DirectIP
      based modems and the standard one for the newer QMI and MBIM based ones.
   ** dell: new plugin for Dell rebranded devices from Novatel, Sierra or
      Ericsson.
   ** gobi: removed the plugin. All non-vendor specific QMI devices should now
      be managed by the generic plugin.
   ** mbm: dynamically load the list of supported modes.
   ** mbm: fixed several connection/disconnection issues.
   ** simtech: support QMI devices.
   ** huawei: implemented Voice call management support.
   ** huawei: use static IP addressing in NDISDUP capable devices if the AT^DHCP
      response provides the IP details.

The following features which were backported to 1.4.x releases are also present
in ModemManager 1.6.0:

 * MBIM:
   ** The mbim-proxy is used by default.
   ** Implemented support for disconnection status notification while connected.
   ** Disabled CDMA capabilities, until properly supported.

 * QMI:
   ** The qmi-proxy is used by default.
   ** If online mode fails, use 'DMS Set FCC Authentication', required by some
      rebranded Sierra modems (e.g. Dell branded ones).
   ** Implemented support for loading SIM operator id and name.
   ** Implemented power-cycle reset functionality.

 * Plugins:
   ** telit: added support for new devices, like HE910, UE910 and UL865.
   ** telit: implemented dynamic port identification.
   ** telit: implemented unlock retries loading.
   ** telit: implemented supported/current bands management.
   ** telit: implemented supported/current modes management.
   ** telit: implemented modem reset and power down.
   ** mbm: implemented GPS support for Ericsson HS2350 and H5321gw modems.


ModemManager 1.4.0
-------------------------------------------
This is a new stable release of ModemManager.

 * This version requires libmbim >= 1.10.0.

This version comes with the following updates in the interfaces:

 * Updated the logic around the IP configuration properties in the Bearer:
   ** Setting DHCP as IP method in the IPv6 settings means that SLAAC should
      be used to retrieve correct addressing and routing details.
   ** DHCP IP method may now be combined with an explicit static IP address, as
      IPv6 SLAAC may require the link-local address to be present.
   ** MTU is now also included in the IP configuration properties, if specified
      by the modem, and applicable to both DHCP and STATIC methods.
 * New 'OFF' power state, which fully switches off the modem device. After
   setting the modem in this state, no further use of it can be done. Currently
   available in Wavecom and Cinterion.
 * Location interface: new 'unmanaged GPS' support, which allows to start/stop
   the GPS module in the modem, while leaving the location information retrieval
   to other processes. Currently available in modems with independent GPS TTYs,
   like Option/HSO, Cinterion and Huawei.
 * New Test DBus interface: not to be installed, just for internal system tests.

Other notable changes include:
 * MBIM: support for ZTE and Sequans Communications modems.
 * Ericsson MBM: Support for AT-capable /dev/cdc-wdm ports.
 * Huawei: improved support for Network time retrieval.
 * Huawei: implemented GPS support.
 * Huawei: support for /dev/cdc-wdm AT ports via the new huawei-cdc-ncm driver.
 * Cinterion: implemented GPS support.
 * Cinterion: implemented unlock retries loading.
 * Cinterion: gather port types for multi-tty devices.
 * Cinterion: custom wait for SIM readiness after SIM-PIN unlock.
 * Wavecom: custom wait for SIM readiness after SIM-PIN unlock.
 * Probing: new flag to identify hotplugged devices which don't need full reset.
 * Tests: internal refactor of the ports handling code, allowing test-driven
   virtual ports and system tests run during 'make check'. This new feature also
   comes with a new internal 'Test' DBus interface, as well as new --test-[*]
   options in the ModemManager program.
 * and many more fixes...
